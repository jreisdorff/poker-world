Poker game, made in React (remix.run), tailwindcss, and websockets.

Mostly tested on a web browser, but it _kinda_ works on mobile. 

Site: http://game-worlds.herokuapp.com/

To play, simply go to the site, type your name, and join the game. The game currently requires 3 players to play.

To run locally, do the following:

Install packages:

npm install

Start the local webserver:

npm run start

The logic is a bit rough around the edges, but it works for the most part.
